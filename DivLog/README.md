# DivLog

DivLog is an online LLM-based log parsing framework via in-context learning. It supports various LLMs as engines through API for high-quality parsing results.

### Running

Install the required enviornment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following scripts to start the demo by replacing "sk-xxx" to your own OpenAI API Key:

```
python demo.py -key sk-xxx
```

Run the following scripts to execute the benchmark by replacing "sk-xxx" to your own OpenAI API Key:

```
python benchmark.py -key sk-xxx
```

Re-generate embeddings by replacing "sk-xxx" to your own OpenAI API Key:

```
python embedding.py -key sk-xxx
```

If you wish to re-run all the results (which may cost much time and api budget), please delete the `results` repository:

```
rm -r results
```

#### Attention:

OpenAI has [shut down](https://platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations/2023-07-06-gpt-and-embeddings) the *Text Completion API* for the GPT-3 model series (`ada`,`babbage`,`curie`,`davinci`) as of January 4th, 2024. If you wish to apply the DivLog framework on other OpenAI *Chat Completion APIs* and re-run all the results, you may need to modify the API request in `BatchParse` of `DivLog.py`. Specifically, you need to replace the original API request design for GPT-3 models with the latest Chat Completion API:

```python
### Replace it
response = openai.Completion.create(
                                    model=model, 
                                    prompt=instruction + "\n\n\n" + prompt + "<prompt>:" + line.strip() + "\n<extraction>: ", 
                                    temperature=temperature,
                                    max_tokens=token_len)
```
